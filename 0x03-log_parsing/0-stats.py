"""
This module reads input from standard input and looks for lines that match a specific pattern.

The pattern is defined as a regular expression in the variable `format_pattern`. Each line of
input is checked against the pattern, and if it matches, the status code and total size are
extracted and added to `status_codes` and `total_sizes`, respectively.

Every 10 input lines, the function `display_output()` is called to output the total file size and
a count of occurrences for each status code.

To use this module, simply pipe input into the script and it will automatically process the input
and output the results.
